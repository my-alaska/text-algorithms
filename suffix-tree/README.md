# trie, suffix tree

This directory contains code implementation for creating a trie structure(trie.ipynb), suffix tree(suffix_tree.ipynb) and a file with visualisation tool for windows(I know...)

Mentioned structures are data structures used for transforming a text for easier substring search

The [ukkonen.ipynb](https://github.com/my-alaska/text-algorithms/blob/main/suffix-tree/ukkonen.ipynb) file contains my implementation of ukkonen's algorithm for linear suffix tree building
